# My dotfiles

This was _heavily_ inspired (pretty much copied) by
[Dries Vints dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles) repo. Just with some
subtle changes having an `omz` directory with the custom oh-my-zsh stuff and to put the
downloaded Powerlevel10k theme for the premade config; `.p10k.zsh`.
